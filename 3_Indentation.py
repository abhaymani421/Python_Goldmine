# In Python, Indentation is used to define blocks of code. 
# It tells the Python interpreter that a group of statements belongs to a specific block. 
# All statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block.
#  Indentation is achieved using whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of each line. 
# The most common convention is to use 4 spaces or a tab, per level of indentation.
print("Hello world") 
        #print("wrong indentation") # the code in the same block should have the same indentation. thus we get indentation error here
